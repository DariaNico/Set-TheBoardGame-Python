# SetAssignment
Things we will need to do:
  Develop a process for determining if 3 cards form a set
  Develop a process for displaying either 12 or 15 cards in a Grid
    We will need to be able to interact with the cards...to select 3
  For the game itself, we will need to be able to start a new game, let the user select 3 cards, check to see if the 3 cards form a set
    if so, remove the cards and insert new cards from the deck
    if not, clear the card selection and indicate that the selection did not form a set
  Once the deck is empty, and no sets are possible, end the game
  Track thinks like time, number of sets found, etc...

For Topics I students: the expectation is that a basic game can be played
For Topics II students: the expectation is that a basic game can be played, and statistics can be tracked and displayed.  Additional features are appreciated.

You should be able to explain your decisions regarding game mechanics.  What process did you use to display your cards? What process did you use to determine if the 3 cards form a set?
