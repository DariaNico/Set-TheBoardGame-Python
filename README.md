# SetAssignment
Things we will need to do:

--Develop a process for determining if 3 cards form a set
  
--Develop a process for displaying either 12 or 15 cards in a Grid
  
--We will need to be able to interact with the cards...to select 3
  
--For the game itself, we will need to be able to start a new game, let the user select 3 cards, check to see if the 3 cards form a set:  if so, remove the cards and insert new cards from the deck.  if not, clear the card selection and indicate that the selection did not form a set
  
--Once the deck is empty, and no sets are possible, end the game
  
--Track things like time, number of sets found, etc...

For Topics I students: the expectation is that a basic game can be played

For Topics II students: the expectation is that a basic game can be played, and statistics can be tracked and displayed.  Additional features are appreciated.

You should be able to explain your decisions regarding game mechanics.  What process did you use to display your cards? What process did you use to determine if the 3 cards form a set? 

We will play each other's games and provide feedback
